<!--  In the app-food-list component, display a list of the foods.
This should include the food's image, its name, and its calorie count.

Notice, we've already imported an array of objects containing food into the component.

Make sure the image's src property is properly bound so that any time the value is
changed in the Typescript class, the change is reflected in the DOM.
